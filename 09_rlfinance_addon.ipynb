        "The model recognizes that large trades can move the market price unfavorably against the trader. This cost is typically modeled as a function of the trade size.\n",

        "### Permanent Impact ($\\eta$)\n",
        "\n",
        "The permanent impact parameter ($\\eta$) captures the long-term effect of trading on the stock price. Each trade has a lasting effect on the price, meaning that once the price has been impacted by a trade, it doesn't revert back due to that trade alone. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n",

This impact is transient and affects the execution price of the trade rather than the lasting price of the stock. It means that a trader might pay a higher price or receive a lower price temporarily due to the trade volume, but this impact doesn't persist beyond the trade itself. In the Almgren-Chriss model, the temporary impact influences the cost of the trade directly rather than the price path of the stock.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Practical Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Temporary Impact in Execution**:\n",
        "   - During execution, each trade incurs an additional cost due to temporary impact.\n",
        "   - This cost doesn't change the observed stock price but affects the cost of execution for the trader.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Total Cost Calculation**:\n",
        "   - When calculating the total cost of an execution strategy, both temporary and permanent impacts are considered.\n",
        "   - The stock price path in the simulation reflects permanent impact but not temporary impact directly because temporary impact is a cost factor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Calculation\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider a simple example to illustrate how temporary impact is considered without affecting the price path:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Permanent Impact**:\n",
        "   - Suppose $\\eta = 0.001$ and a trader sells $1000$ shares.\n",
        "   - The permanent impact would change the stock price by $ \\eta \\times 1000 = 1 $ unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Temporary Impact**:\n",
        "   - Suppose $\\gamma = 0.001$ and the trader sells $1000$ shares over $\\Delta t$.\n",
        "   - The temporary impact cost is $ \\gamma \\left( \\frac{1000}{\\Delta t} \\right)^2 \\Delta t $.\n",
        "   - This cost is added to the execution cost but does not change the observed stock price after the trade is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The temporary impact factor ($\\gamma$) affects the cost of executing trades by increasing the execution price for the trader. However, it does not permanently alter the observed stock price path, which is why the temporary impact does not appear in the price series directly. Instead, it is accounted for in the total execution cost, reflecting the higher prices paid or lower prices received due to the immediate impact of the trade."

        "3. **Liquidity Risk**: Execution risk arises from the volatility of the stock price during the trading period.\n",

        "1. **Volatility ($\\sigma$)**:\n",
        "   - **Historical Volatility**: Calculate the standard deviation of historical stock returns over a specified period. This involves computing the daily returns of the stock, then calculating the standard deviation of these returns and annualizing it.\n",
        "   - **GARCH Models**: Use Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models to estimate time-varying volatility. These models can capture the clustering of volatility observed in financial markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Linear Market Impact Parameter ($\\eta$)**:\n",
        "   - **Regression Analysis**: Perform a regression of the stock price changes against the volume of trades. The coefficient from this regression represents the permanent impact of trades on stock prices.\n",
        "   - **Market Microstructure Models**: Use models from market microstructure theory that relate order flow to price impact. For instance, the Kyle model can be used where the market impact is proportional to the volume traded.\n",

        "3. **Temporary Market Impact Parameter ($\\gamma$)**:\n",
